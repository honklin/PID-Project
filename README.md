## Planning
### Project Description and Requirements
ðŸ˜ƒ Design, Build, and Program a device that uses PID feedback control. ðŸ˜ƒ 

Requirements:
Use only an Arduino and other standard components in the Sigma Lab
Use 4 or 6 AA batteries and a battery pack for power
Include a power switch and an LED power indicator
Ensure everything is securely mounted (the Arduino can use standoffs or rubber feet)

We created a ping pong ball floater using PID limits. The motor is housed in a box with a tube extending out of the top and is controlled by a rotary controller and LCD.

### Reflection
In the begining of the prject, CAD design was started before we fully understood what method was going to be used to propell the ball intothe air. I started designing a funnel for a different fan.

T-slot neglegence. I definetley realized what not do when using T-Slots and Laser Joints. The T-Slots/laser joints arent actually hindering any part of the design, they are just really asymetrical and ugly. The only sight problem this created was the asymitericalness caused the top of the box to only fit one way. We reaized this after it was assembled and had to do a bit of reassembly so that al the parts would fit.
